  abstract  = "Cluster analysis is the automated search for groups of related
               observations in a dataset. Most clustering done in practice is
               based largely on heuristic but intuitively reasonable
               procedures, and most clustering methods available in commercial
               software are also of this type. However, there is little
               systematic guidance associated with these methods for solving
               important practical questions that arise in cluster analysis,
               such as how many clusters are there, which clustering method
               should be used, and how should outliers be handled. We review a
               general methodology for model-based clustering that provides a
               principled statistical approach to these issues. We also show
               that this can be useful for other problems in multivariate
               analysis, such as discriminant analysis and multivariate density
               estimation. We give examples from medical diagnosis, minefield
               detection, cluster recovery from noisy data, and spatial density
               estimation. Finally, we mention limitations of the methodology
               and discuss recent developments in model-based clustering for
               non-Gaussian data, high-dimensional datasets, large datasets,
               and Bayesian estimation.",

  abstract      = "Given a vertex of interest in a network $G_1$, the vertex
                   nomination problem seeks to find the corresponding vertex of
                   interest (if it exists) in a second network $G_2$. A vertex
                   nomination scheme produces a list of the vertices in $G_2$,
                   ranked according to how likely they are judged to be the
                   corresponding vertex of interest in $G_2$. The vertex
                   nomination problem and related information retrieval tasks
                   have attracted much attention in the machine learning
                   literature, with numerous applications to social and
                   biological networks. However, the current framework has
                   often been confined to a comparatively small class of
                   network models, and the concept of statistically consistent
                   vertex nomination schemes has been only shallowly explored.
                   In this paper, we extend the vertex nomination problem to a
                   very general statistical model of graphs. Further, drawing
                   inspiration from the long-established classification
                   framework in the pattern recognition literature, we provide
                   definitions for the key notions of Bayes optimality and
                   consistency in our extended vertex nomination framework,
                   including a derivation of the Bayes optimal vertex
                   nomination scheme. In addition, we prove that no universally
                   consistent vertex nomination schemes exist. Illustrative

               general introduction to machine learning that can serve as a
               textbook for graduate students and a reference for researchers.
               It covers fundamental modern topics in machine learning while
               providing the theoretical basis and conceptual tools needed for
               the discussion and justification of algorithms. It also
               describes several key aspects of the application of these
               algorithms. The authors aim to present novel theoretical tools
               and concepts while giving concise proofs even for relatively
               advanced topics. Foundations of Machine Learning is unique in
               its focus on the analysis and theory of algorithms. The first
               four chapters lay the theoretical foundation for what follows;
               subsequent chapters are mostly self-contained. Topics covered
               include the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning
               framework; generalization bounds based on Rademacher complexity
               and VC-dimension; Support Vector Machines (SVMs); kernel

              a sequence of changing classifiers. When proving shifting bounds
              for kernel-based classifiers, one also faces the problem of
              storing a number of support vectors that can grow unboundedly,
              unless an eviction policy is used to keep this number under
              control. In this paper, we show that shifting and on-line
              learning on a budget can be combined surprisingly well. First, we
              introduce and analyze a shifting Perceptron algorithm achieving
              the best known shifting bounds while using an unlimited budget.
              Second, we show that by applying to the Perceptron algorithm the
              simplest possible eviction policy, which discards a random
              support vector each time a new one comes in, we achieve a
              shifting bound close to the one we obtained with no budget
              restrictions. More importantly, we show that our randomized
              algorithm strikes the optimal trade-off $$U =
              \textbackslashTheta(\textbackslashsqrt\{B\})$$between budget B
              and norm U of the largest classifier in the comparison sequence.
              Experiments are presented comparing several linear-threshold
              algorithms on chronologically-ordered textual datasets. These
              experiments support our theoretical findings in that they show to
              what extent randomized budget algorithms are more robust than
              deterministic ones when learning shifting target data streams.",

  abstract = "Decision trees are among the most popular types of classifiers,
              with interpretability and ease of implementation being among
              their chief attributes. Despite the widespread use of decision
              trees, theoretical analysis of their performance has only begun
              to emerge in recent years. In this paper, it is shown that a new
              family of decision trees, dyadic decision trees (DDTs), attain
              nearly optimal (in a minimax sense) rates of convergence for a
              broad range of classification problems. Furthermore, DDTs are
              surprisingly adaptive in three important respects: they
              automatically 1) adapt to favorable conditions near the Bayes
              decision boundary; 2) focus on data distributed on lower
              dimensional manifolds; and 3) reject irrelevant features. DDTs
              are constructed by penalized empirical risk minimization using a
              new data-dependent penalty and may be computed exactly with
              computational complexity that is nearly linear in the training
              sample size. DDTs comprise the first classifiers known to achieve
              nearly optimal rates for the diverse class of distributions
              studied here while also being practical and implementable. This
              is also the first study (of which we are aware) to consider rates

                   scientific discovery in the big data age. We proposed the
                   Multiscale Generalized Correlation (MGC) in Shen et al. 2017
                   as a novel correlation measure, which worked well
                   empirically and helped a number of real data discoveries.
                   But there is a wide gap with respect to the theoretical

                   learning procedure over consecutive tasks, where learning a
                   given task depends on accumulated knowledge --- the
                   so-called knowledge base. Most published work on lifelong
                   learning makes a batch processing of each task, implying
                   that a data collection step is required beforehand. We are
                   proposing a new framework, lifelong online learning, in
                   which the learning procedure for each task is interactive.
                   This is done through a computationally efficient algorithm
                   where the predicted result for a given task is made by
                   combining two intermediate predictions: by using only the
                   information from the current task and by relying on the
                   accumulated knowledge. In this work, two challenges are
                   tackled: making no assumption on the task generation
                   distribution, and processing with a possibly unknown number
                   of instances for each task. We are providing a theoretical
                   analysis of this algorithm, with a cumulative error upper

                   conditions, the algorithm can still benefit from a small
                   cumulative error even when facing few interactions.

               Lifelong Machine Learning, Second Edition Lifelong Machine
               Learning (or Lifelong Learning) is an advanced machine learning
               paradigm that learns continuously, accumulates the knowledge
               learned in previous tasks, and uses it to help future learning.
               In the process, the learner becomes more and more knowledgeable
               and effective at learning. This learning ability is one of the
               hallmarks of human intelligence. However, the current dominant
               machine learning paradigm learns in isolation: given a training
               dataset, it runs a machine learning algorithm on the dataset to
               produce a model. It makes no attempt to retain the learned
               knowledge and use it in future learning. Although this isolated
               learning paradigm has been very successful, it requires a large
               number of training examples, and is only suitable for
               well-defined and narrow tasks. In comparison, we humans can
               learn effectively with a few examples because we have
               accumulated so much knowledge in the past which enables us to
               learn with little data or effort. Lifelong learning aims to
               achieve this capability. As statistical machine learning
               matures, it is time to make a major effort to break the isolated
               learning tradition and to study lifelong learning to bring
               machine learning to new heights. Applications such as
               intelligent assistants, chatbots, and physical robots that
               interact with humans and systems in real-life environments are
               also calling for such lifelong learning capabilities. Without
               the ability to accumulate the learned knowledge and use it to
               learn more knowledge incrementally, a system will probably never

  abstract   = "Transfer learning has received a lot of attention in the
                machine learning community over the last years, and several
                effective algorithms have been developed. However, relatively
                little is known about their theoretical properties, especially
                in the setting of lifelong learning, where the goal is to
                transfer information to tasks for which no data have been
                observed so far. In this work we study lifelong learning from a
                theoretical perspective. Our main result is a PAC-Bayesian
                generalization bound that offers a unified view on existing
                paradigms for transfer learning, such as the transfer of
                parameters or the transfer of low-dimensional representations.
                We also use the bound to derive two principled lifelong
                learning algorithms, and we show that these yield results
                comparable with existing methods.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Lifelong Machine Learning, or LML, considers systems
               that can learn many tasks from one or more domains over its
               lifetime. The goal is to sequentially retain learned knowledge
               and to selectively transfer that knowledge when learning a new
               task so as to develop more accurate hypotheses or policies.
               Following a review of prior work on LML, we propose that it is
               now appropriate for the AI community to move beyond learning
               algorithms to more seriously consider the nature of systems that
               are capable of learning over a lifetime …",

  abstract   = "The problem of learning multiple consecutive tasks, known as
                lifelong learning, is of great importance to the creation of
                intelligent, general-purpose, and flexible machines. In this
                paper, we develop a method for online multi-task learning in
                the lifelong learning setting. The proposed Efficient Lifelong
                Learning Algorithm (ELLA) maintains a sparsely shared basis for
                all task models, transfers knowledge from the basis to learn
                each new task, and refines the basis over time to maximize
                performance across all tasks. We show that ELLA has strong
                connections to both online dictionary learning for sparse
                coding and state-of-the-art batch multi-task learning methods,

  abstract   = "It has been a long-standing goal in machine learning, as well
                as in AI more generally, to develop life-long learning systems
                that learn many different tasks over time, and reuse insights
                from tasks learned, ``learning to learn'' as they do so. In
                this work we pose and provide efficient algorithms for several
                natural theoretical formulations of this goal. Specifically, we
                consider the problem of learning many different target
                functions over time, that share certain commonalities that are
                initially unknown to the learning algorithm. Our aim is to
                learn new internal representations as the algorithm learns new
                target functions, that capture this commonality and allow
                subsequent learning tasks to be solved more efficiently and
                from less data. We develop efficient algorithms for two very
                different kinds of commonalities that target functions might
                share: one based on learning common low-dimensional and unions
                of low-dimensional subspaces and one based on learning
                nonlinear Boolean combinations of features. Our algorithms for
                learning Boolean feature combinations additionally have a dual
                interpretation, and can be viewed as giving an efficient
                procedure for constructing near-optimal sparse Boolean
                autoencoders under a natural ``anchor-set'' assumption.",

              variation of the source. We present two random forest transfer
              algorithms. The first algorithm searches greedily for locally
              optimal modifications of each tree structure by trying to locally
              expand or reduce the tree around individual nodes. The second
              algorithm does not modify structure, but only the parameter
              (thresholds) associated with decision nodes. We also propose to
              combine both methods by considering an ensemble that contains the
              union of the two forests. The proposed methods exhibit impressive
              experimental results over a range of problems.",
